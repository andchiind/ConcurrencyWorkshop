# Thank you for attending this "presentation" on concurrency

To run the examples:

1. Make sure python is installed

2. Open this folder in vscode

2. Run "python main.py" using the vscode launch files included in the .vscode folder (if you run the programs in a terminal without a debugger then it might be hard to force the program to exit when a thread is stuck)

3. To run other examples, edit the main.py file to point to a different function
